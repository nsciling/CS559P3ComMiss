Notes:

Functionalities implemented:
- Collision detection: player missles collide with enemy missiles
- Procedurally-generated images: the buildings are built randomly, enemy missiles fire randomly, explosions and smoke are built procedurally
- Explosion simulations: when player missiles collide with enemy missiles, the enemy missiles explode
- Simple path traversal: missiles follow straight-line paths
- Object rotations: while not actually utilizing true canvas rotations, the player's turret 
- End-user input handling: turret follows user mouse; user can press keys to affect the game, such as pressing the Escape key to pause

Functionalities originally planned, but NOT implemented, due to time limitations:
- no curves in this game
- no articulated objects in this game
