A take on Missile Command: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command.
Missile Command is copyrighted by Atari, 1981; this project owes its inspiration to Atari.

Project Objective:
Create an interactive 2D game using concepts learned in CS559

Functionalities implemented:
- Collision detection: player missles collide with enemy missiles
- Procedurally-generated images: the buildings are built randomly, enemy missiles fire randomly, explosions and smoke are built procedurally
- Explosion simulations: when player missiles collide with enemy missiles, the enemy missiles explode
- Simple path traversal: missiles follow straight-line paths
- Object rotations: while not actually utilizing true canvas rotations, the player's turret 
- End-user input handling: turret follows user mouse; user can press keys to affect the game, such as pressing the Escape key to pause

Functionalities originally planned, but NOT implemented, due to time limitations:
- no curves in this game
- no articulated objects in this game

How to play:
1. Go to https://nsciling.github.io/CS559P4ComMiss/
2. Press 'S' to start the game
3. Left click to fire anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs). Fire these at enemy missiles. If the enemy missiles collide with your ABMs' explosion, the enemy missiles will explode.
4. For every enemy you defeat, you will gain 1 point. For every 5 points you score, enemy intensity will increase:
-- they will get faster
-- they will increase in number
-- new enemies will appear: larger ones that are slower but do more damange, and smaller ones that are faster and do less damage
5. If enemy missles hit your city, your health will decrease by the following amounts:
-- red (basic) enemies do 5 damage
-- orange (large) enemies do 10 damage
-- yellow (small) enemies do 3 damage
6. Press 'Esc' to pause
7. Upon Game Over, your final score will be displayed. To play again, press the Refresh button below the canvas, or refresh your browser window.
