	<h1>Command Missile</h1>
	<h3>Background</h3>
	<blockquote>
		This game was made by Nick Scilingo as a coding project for UW-Madison's CS559-Computer Graphics course, spring 2024.<br>
		This game is a take on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command">Missile Command</a>, a classic arcade game from Atari.<br>
		This was made for purely educational purposes. 
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Game Premise</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Your city is under attack!<br>
		Prevent enemy missiles from hitting your city. Use your anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs) to protect the city.<br>
		Stop enemy missles from reaching the city by blowing them up with your ABMs.
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Controls</h3>
	<blockquote>
		Press <b>S</b> to start the game.
		<br>Press <b>ESC</b> to pause.
		<br><b>Left click</b> to fire an anti-ballistic missile. You have 9 missles that reload after they explode.
	</blockquote>
	<h3>Scoring</h3>
	<blockquote>
		For every enemy missile you defeat, you will gain 1 point. Every <span id="milestone">10</span> points you gain, enemy intensity will increase.
		<br>If an enemy missile hits your town, you will lose city health. Different enemy types affect health differently.
		<br><br>If your city loses all of its health, <b>GAME OVER</b>!<br>
